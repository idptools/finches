What is FINCHES?
-------------------
FINCHES is a Python package developed for predicting chemical specificity between an IDR and a partner. 


Key background
-------------------
Intrinsically disordered proteins and regions (IDRs) can interact with a variety of partners, including folded domains and other IDRs. Those interactions can broadly be driven by two modes of molecule recognition: sequence-specific molecular recognition, and chemically-specific molecular recognition.
