## Implementation of "Analytical Solution to the Floryâ€“Huggins Model"

#### Original content (2022-08-25)
Python library for calculating Flory-Huggins spinodal, approximate (Ginzburg-Landau) binodal and binodal (using the self-consistent approach).

descriptions of defined functions and inputs can be call using FH.help()


#### Alex' notes
The code here in `backend.fh` (originally called `fh.py`) [was taken from this GitHub repo](https://github.com/KnowlesLab-Cambridge/FloryHuggins) 

The public facing functions are found in `floryhuggins.py` which we have written and are user-friendly wrappers around the code in `backend.py`.
